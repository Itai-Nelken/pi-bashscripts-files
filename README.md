# pi-bashscripts-files
A collection of Bash scripts and files useful for the Raspberry Pi 4 and other models.

Please note that all of these scripts were tested on a Raspberry Pi 4 running Raspberry Pi OS (32 bit) off of a 16 GB SanDisk MicroSD card and/or a 500 GB Samsung T7 SSD.

Using any other operating system may result in unexpected installation failures or may break your system, so if not using RPiOS 32bit, **be prepared for failures.**

### installation files and such
I have organized everything into folders. Some folders may have install scripts, some may have packages, or links, or something else. Only use this repository if you know what you're doing.
